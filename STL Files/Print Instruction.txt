You'll need multiple copies of the connection pins, both long and short. The long ones go in the base and connect the shell together. The short ones connect the bezel to the shell.

I recommend printing the left and right shell on its side. Most pieces can be oriented so they don't require supports. 

None of the pieces have holes in them for buttons or power. You'll have to drill those out for your own needs.

The shell was designed to hold a 4.3" lcd screen - specifically this model: https://www.adafruit.com/product/1680
It might work with others or could easily be modified.
